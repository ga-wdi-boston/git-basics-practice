# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
By doing! Reading the articles weren't nearly as effective as the repetitive
git commands in class through trial and error.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?


```md
I'll say the atlassian reading. It was very in depth and helped reinforce the
lessons today.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
Learn Git branching. It was frustrating having to keep clicking through and
hitting "objective" for queues.```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
For day two I'd say pretty comfortable. It will only get easier as we use it
each day.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
not at this time. A few about merge conflicts but we will visit that later.```
