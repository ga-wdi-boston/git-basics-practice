# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best by reading a concise overview of a subject, reviewing a couple of examples, then actually doing it.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The Atlassian tutorial on workflows was the resource that helped me most. It gave detailed use cases with flow diagrams as well as git command examples that did a good job of demonstrating the context of how git is used.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I found learngitbranching.js.org the most frustrating. I thought it was too busy and required too much clicking to get to the information.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
Fairly comfortable. Looking forward to using the commands some more over the next few days for practice.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
No burning questions. It makes sense.
```
