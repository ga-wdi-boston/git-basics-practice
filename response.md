# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best by seeing someone
perform a task and then replicating
it myself.  I'm a visual learner.  I find it difficult if I'm trying to perform a task and there is instruction being given at the same time - I'm not good at focusing on the task at hand because I'm concerned that I'm missing what's being discussed.  That's happened a few times.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I liked Code School's tutorial -
very easy to follow.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I got stuck
on Learn Git Branching tutorial
on revert / reset in the Main > Ramping Up level 4.  I spent over an
hour on one task and couldn't get it
to work.  Since they didn't show how to perform both a reset and revert together, I'm sure it was something I just hadn't figured out.  I tried googling but couldn't find the correct solution.  There is no real help to provide the answer and let you move on.  perhaps I should have skipped
it so I could spend more time on push and pull.

Also, I find navigating within that tutorial to be difficult.  If I needed to go back and review, I often found myself 'stuck ' with no way to get back without exiting the browser and relaunching and navigating back to the start of that lesson.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I'm more comfortable now than I was before class today, but need more practice.

I didn't understand the topic of remote pushes & pulls.  Need more review.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
I just need to better understand remote repositories and if/how we will use them.
```
