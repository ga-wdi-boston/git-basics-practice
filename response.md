# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
Visually for sure. Practicing and actually doing helps me the most.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The Comparing Workflows tutorial from Atlassin cleared up a lot with how we may
use Git in the real world or on projects. Google helped a lot as well.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I wouldnt say frustating... but tryGit used some "never do these" practices that
we learned in class.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
4/5
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
In practice is the git pull command (for the purpose of making sure there
are no new additions since the last time you had it) traditionally ran after you
have commited your changes OR do you stage your changes run the pull THEN commit
and push?

UPDATE: JK i googled it lol. realised we went over this.
