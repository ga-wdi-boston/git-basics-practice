# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
The process of viewing something (for example the forking/cloning of a git) and then doing it ourselves with help available has been surper useful.  I've also found repetiion really works for me, so all these different external resources are very helpful to drill out the whatever the commands over and over and commit them to memeory. 
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
While intimidating at first the git branching interactive game was really helpful, after re-doing it it really started to click.  Also again all the different resources around the same topic help strengthen aspects that one may not have fully covered. ```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
Yet to really come across any that were frustrating. ```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
Confident in terms of understanding the different commands and the tasks they accomplish.  The concept of mergin and rebasing is a little hazy still just in that I'd like to see a practical example of when commits conflict with one another.```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Ben what does git status do again?  I kid, but I guess the biggest question again would be how to handle merges and rebasing and how to know the conflict you are resolving won't break everything.```
