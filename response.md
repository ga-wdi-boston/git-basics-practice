# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best when there are notes already prepared for us, where I can
follow along and add my own notes to it to review later. It's difficult to
listen and understand the lecture while taking notes at the same time,
especially during lab work where we must code along.

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
Interactive resources like the "Learn Git Branching" and "Try Git" tutorials
that provide animation/visuals that clearly show each step.

```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
"Comparing Workflows" tutorial was the most frustrating, because it's
non-interactive. Even with some visual aids, it was hard for me to follow as
the reading was long. However, I understand that as web developers you will
have to be able to read through long documents that usually have no visual
aids without problem.

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
On a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being most comfortable), 3. I would be more comfortable
once I practice more hands-on. <!-- your answer here -->

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
1. I cannot fully grasp git rm â€”cache fileName.md. I understand that this
allows you to unstage the file while staging the deleted file, but I don't
understand what it means to "stage" a file for deletion.
2. In 1.17: Undo lesson of the "Try Git" tutorial, I could not fully
understand git checkout --octocat.txt. I understand that files can be changed
back to how they were at the last commit by using this command, but why does
the octodog.txt file NOT get deleted from the Octobox repository, in the
octofamily directory?
