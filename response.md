# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
Lots of repetition and pictures. 
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I liked this resource the best: http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/#

It wasn't linked in tonight's practice material, but it was linked in today's training material.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I thought the octocat was too easy to copy and paste.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I would say I'm a 6/10 comfort level but I'm confident that I will get it after more practice.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Are the git commands and workflow specific to GitHub? Or is git the common language used across different branded source control applications?
```
