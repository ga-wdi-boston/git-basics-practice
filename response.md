# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I tend to learn best in active projects which require me to apply that which I
have learned. Tutorials are nice, but actually using the concepts is also very
valuable. I like having a saved store of code to use as a reference, though this
is not entirely feasible with git.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
Both of the interactive visual tutorials were very helpful, especially the learn
git branching one, as it was a very visual manifestation of the concept. I found the Atlassian tutorial to be far less helpful, largely because it was more focused on
industry standards, rather than the nuts and bolts of git practices.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
Not necessarily frustrating, but I really did not find the atlassian piece to be particularly useful, largely due to its length, its emphasis on how to manage version
control in a team, and its lack of any interactivity.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I am fairly comfortable with the local steps, though I remain a bit untested and
thus apprehensive about the process of git pulling, but I imagine these will subside
as I use the function with more frequency
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Nothing comes to mind at the moment.
