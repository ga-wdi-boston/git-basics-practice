# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
by actually attempting to do thing with examples / try and error
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I like the "learn git branching" turtorials.  Tools that are interactive with
examples etc are work better for me in general
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
As of right now nothing really.  I dont mind the documents so far but when it
get deep into things i rather do things with a project/group so i can bounce
ideas and questions off people etc.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
Dont have an issue with GIT, I say i'm about a 4 out of 5 or 5/5 on GIT.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Nothing at the moment.  
```
