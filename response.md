# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
A combination of code along and time to independently practice the ideas we
covered seems to work best for me.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I enjoyed the Comparing Workflows tutorial because it's a very practical overview
and touches on real world examples.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I found parts of the Learn Git Branching tutorial to be frustrating. Some explanations/
directions were not clear and some of the illustrative diagrams were confusing. Still
trying to work through these.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
4/5
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
I'm still a bit confused about how best to keep local repos up to date. I found the
exercise we did to set up a remote repo to be confusing. Curious how to implement
best practices for refreshing local repos. I would anticipate this is a big concern
when working on open source projects
