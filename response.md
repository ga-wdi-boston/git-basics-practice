# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
Working through examples with detailed instructions or following along with the
instructor and then trying a similiar example on my own. 
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The Git tutorial was helpful because it was interactive and allowed me to practice
the git commands.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
The branch diagrams were confusing and I don't feel like I fully grasp them. It
would be helpful to walk through it step by step and discuss each component that
makes up the diagram rather than just viewing the final product.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
3/5 at this time although I'm sure as we continue to use this on a daily basis
I'll become more comfortable.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
When should you rebase vs. merge?
```
