# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I'll be honest. I have gotten quite confused with GIT, especially pull and push and branches. The 2nd half of today's lecture was where I started to fall behind. I was fine with fork,clone, edit changes and commits back to the repo but got lost this afternoon. I read all the tutorials and have gotten more confused.
Now I completed WDI fundamentals in 4 days but this is the most confusing so far.
I learn best by taking it  one step, doing an example together with the instructor and then doing it by yourself with TA support. I don't like the group work at this point as it puts extra pressure on me on trying to work with someone who has more knowledge in GIT.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?


```md
I am sure that the material i read tonight is going to be useful...but not right now. I'd rather do lots of small practice examples on GIT and bash rather than reading it. I spent 2 hours on it tonight and am not much clearer than at 5pm. I'll try to carve out some time tomorrow evening to do a few examples myself especially with push and pull.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I found tonight's reading the most frustrating. It is not that it is not useful material...but I am just too green now on GIT to fully appreciate what it is saying and I'm stressing out as I  don't have a clear picture and am concerned that I won't keep up with GIT especially on team based work.<!-- your answer here -->

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I'm sorry to say that I am not that comfortable with GIT apart from the basics of fork, clone, edit. I ran out of time tonight and hope to have more capacity tomorrow evening to attempt some actual examples myself.
If there is some time tomorrow to walk through one more example slowly (and even something we could then use as a refernce) that would be great. If not, I understand and I'll figure it out myself somehow.

Thank you
