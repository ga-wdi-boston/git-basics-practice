# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I am a visual learner. I learn best through explanations that include visual elements such as writing the code, diagrams, whiteboard, etc. I also do well with actually doing things, such as a step by step tutorial or assignment.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I found the CodeSchool's tryGit to be the most useful. I liked going step by step through the process.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I found it hard to fully understand the various workflows from the article. It would have been helpful if there were clearer visuals or diagrams of how it all worked.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I am comfortable with the workflow we learned in class and the workflow used for responses. I am somewhat hazy on some of the additional ones from the article that involve rebasing and merging.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
The workflow article on git mentioned rebasing and I am somewhat struggling to understand how it is different from regular merging. It would be helpful to have additional explanation provided.
```
