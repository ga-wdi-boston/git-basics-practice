# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I usually learn best by being hands on. However, I am adept at learning
abstract concepts via lecture, but they don't solidify until i put them in
practice, usually.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The interactive bits were helpful, but I found concise explanations of the
commands to be moe helpful.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
So far I am quite comfortable with all materials and resources in the class. I felt some of the pre-work might be confusing to folks who are not as familiar. I am happy to discuss specifics if you would like that granular of feedback - i.e. i can provide specific spots in the prework i think need tweaking or further clarification. Specifially there were some steps that seemed to introduce bits of code that were not previously mentioned. I feel this is probably due to multiple versions of the material that don't fully jive...or maybe i missed something. Stranger things have happened. lol
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I tried to make a brand new repository out of my prework and found that I skipped the commit phase since I already had a repository- this was a great learning experience. While that makes sense, it did give me a moment of pause. Overall, I am solid, but feel more exposure will make it rock solid.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
I feel the material was covered in class very well and any questions I did have to this point were answered. That said, I am sure as we go along I will have more questions.
```
