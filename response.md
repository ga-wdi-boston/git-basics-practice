# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I need to see high level (pictures/diagrams help a lot) with a use case. And then do it by following  step by step instructions. And then discuss each step and its meaning.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
Executing the exercises along with a step by step (the GA document) lesson helped me the most. Next to that was the Learn Git interactive module.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
The lesson on the terminal commands was the most frustrating. The delivery of the lesson didn't seem as polished and organized as the other consultant lessons. Also, a separate lesson/cheat sheet on Mac basics would have been helpful. The very brief lesson with Finder was too brief. Especially when the instructor doesn't know a whole lot of the windows environment in which the class is familiar. But, to be fair, I'm not sure that a lot of the class is that familiar with the more technical terms for the windows environment either.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I'm solid with the fork-clone-edit-add-commit-push workflow. Switching between master and other branches makes me nervous. I'm shaky with how remotes factor into the whole workflow. I need more practical practice. I think a step by step instruction on any new workflows will help immensely until I am solid on more complex steps.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
No. I'm ok with waiting to see how we use it for our projects.
```
