# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

I learn best by watching a demo and then doing it until I get with the opportunity to ask questions. Reading a bunch of stuff is not helpful for me.

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

Honestly, the demo and practice in class was a really positive experience and the readings and interactive lessons in the practice weren't super helpful.

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

the interactive git tutorial that just told us what to type in was frustrating

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

2/5. I thought I was good but this is the 4th time i've attempted to do this assignment. The branch concept is still very fuzzy.

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

I will.
