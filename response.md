# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best by trying something, then having someone explain why/how the thing I just did works and then trying it again with a little less guidance.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The Atlassian article, but only because I was somewhat familiar with Git already.  I think if I was brand new to it then the CodeSchool resource would have been more effective.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I didn't think any of the resources were frustrating.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I am fine with the basic commands like add, commit, push, pull.  If I had to unstage files or remove changes I would definitely need to look it up.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Not really.
```
