# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best through visualization and practice - essentially grasping the theories conceptually and then drilling over and over again to consolidate that information.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I especially liked the Atlassian tutorial. It presented information in a very organized way, helped visualize the workflow (which after so much information in class, felt a little cloudy), and explained why it is so important to developers who are working in a team. But more importantly, it provided good examples of what a workflow looks like in the "real" world.
CodeSchool's 'Try Git' tutorial was helpful too - it was simple but definitely helped consolidate the information we went over in class earlier.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
For me, there was no frustration.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
Overall I feel comfortable with the workflow, although more practice is needed (which I'm sure we'll have!).
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Is it possible to revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public?
```
