These are my responses to our homework questions

How do you learn best?

I learn best through audio description, and visual represenation. I get lost in reading and following written tutorials without a visual guide to go with it.

Which resources from this document helped you the most?

The two visual games asking for git input is a great way for me to get a grasp on git commands. Reading about them and taking notes doesn't help me retain any of the commands.

Which resource (if any) was most frustrating? Why?

The reading materials are frustrating. I personally have a hard time decoding all the dense material in that form, and it takes me much longer to complete then others. The difference in how I retain the same information presented in an audio format is huge.

How comfortable are you with the workflow (series of steps and git commands) we use to share work and responses?

I am becoming more and more comfortable with it. I will defintely still have questions and second guess each step. Howeer, I would rather be safe then sorry in setting up new path ways.

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this course?

Yes but its less a specific question, and more and general still trying to grasp all of the concepts. Which I assume is normal for the pace at which the class moves. If I defintely will ask questions as they arrise and can articulate appropriately.
