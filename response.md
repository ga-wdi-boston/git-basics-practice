# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best when I understand real world applications of concepts we learn in class. As an example, we learned today about adding an upstream remote repository. It didn't click until I understood a potential real world application i.e. adding an enterprise style-guide remote repository to pull from. I learn through concrete examples.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The Comparing Workflows examples (i.e. John and Mary), and also just the process of creating the response branch to submit this questionnaire.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
The conceptual parts of Comparing Workflows didn't work as well as the examples.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
Comfortable enough to start applying it to group projects
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Can't wait to start applying this knowledge in the group project!
```
