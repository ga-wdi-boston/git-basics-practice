I like to read with examples - but for things like git - a visual guide is
helpful.

They are all good at different levels.  But I liked the "Try Git" tutorial and I
think the "Learn Version Control with Git" was good.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I didn't find any of them frustrating.  Maybe there were too many choices.

Pretty comfortable.
```

## Git Questions
