Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best through a combination of practice, lectures and visuals such as
videos or diagrams.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I found the git learning branch the most helpful. The reading was well written
but a bit redundant.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
The fact that the reading was near identical to the lesson (though I understand
the use of this on more advanced lessons.)
```

commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I feel very comfortable with what we learned so far!
```

## Git Questions
