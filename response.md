# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I learn best by doing and by viewing demonstrations first. I am a visual learner.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
The Git branching tutorial helped me most because I was able to physically see where directories and files were being created and placed.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Most frustrating was the Try Git tutorial on Github, because it was least descriptive for changes that were made. It would show a file that I moved or removed from the directory, but it was not as helpful since it was not a real file or repository.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?


```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I understand it conceptually (as it is very similar to JIRA workflows I've worked with), but I need more practice.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
At what point (if any) will we learn more about Git workflows?
```
