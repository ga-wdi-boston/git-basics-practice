# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
Visual and making notes.  Today with the diagram of the git flow was very
helpful.  It gave me a reference point to what was abstract.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I liked the Atlassian article. It had both the visual component and actual
commands along with the examples. It mirrors what I 'hear' some of the
dev's at work talk about features. Often they will merge code in the master, but
it will be turned off. How does that work in this model?
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
CodeSchool was not frustrating but it felt more like a typing excerise.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
The workflow along with the steps and git commands all make sense.  The
challenge is putting it all into practice and using the steps to perform
real work. I think sometimes it gets confusing when some things are similar and
worded one way, then another. Doing this response. It asked us to 'checkout
to a new branch'...which I assumed was 'clone'.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
I think it is clear how we will use it and the role it plays. Code is merged
into the master but 'turned off'.  I wonder how this works.  I understand
the benefits of why you want to merge it.  I'm curious how it is turned off.
```
