# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best with project-based, hands-on curriculum. I enjoy doing things and learn best through trial-and-error. I learn best when systems/communities hold me accountable to a clear set of standards.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I enjoyed working through the CodeSchool tutorial.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
None - I thought that the required practice material was clear and informative.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I am pretty comfortable with the workflow: Fork (use GitHub GUI) -> Clone -> Checkout Branch -> Make Changes -> Save -> Add -> Commit -> Push -> Pull (use GitHub GUI)
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed?

What should you look for before accepting a merge request?
