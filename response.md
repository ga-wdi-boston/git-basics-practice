# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I'm an auditory and visual learner mostly. I usually try to power read through
the material I'm trying to understand, then I try to watch videos on the subject
to get a different perspective on the material. I usually read it again the
following day and during that second reading the material really stick.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The visual interactive learner helped the most. Though it also has highlighted
how I'm still confused in some ways.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
Actually I feel like everything was useful.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I'm quite comfortable with the series of steps needed to fork, clone, edit add
commit and push files. I'm still not totally clear on the workflows.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Not burning ones, no.
