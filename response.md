# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I learn best by "doing."  However, that is most effective when preceded by independent reading and/or instructor overviews to help establish a baseline of knowledge.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->

I found the Comparing Workflows from Atlassian and CodeSchool's Try Git to be be helpful.

```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->

I didn't find any of the resources to be frustrating.

```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->

I feel fairly confident with the workflow, but certainly wouldn't consider myself to have mastered all of the material yet.  However, I expect that this master will come with continued practice.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->

No burning questions.
