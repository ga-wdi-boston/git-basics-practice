# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I learn best by doing, it is hard for me to learn through conversation/visualzation. Code alongs and practices help me the most.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
Code schools try it was good, but I really liked the link here from additional resources A TON for the visuals/try it:
http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/

I thought that made all the GIT comand concepts crazy clear.  I especially like the combo of visuals and doing it.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I did not really like the reading, it was basically the same thing as Mike's talk.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
3/5 - but would guess that'll be 5/5 by EOD tommorrow :)
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
No
