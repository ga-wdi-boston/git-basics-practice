# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?
I learn best when mixing reading and tutorials, especially when prior material
is needed to complete new objectives as I believe this helps to reinforce
the material.

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)


```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?
The required reading was fine but when introduced as long winded as it was
retention and comprehension declines by the line.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I think it will take a few rounds of doing it before it really sinks in.  Now
I'm hoping I do all the steps good but I have to check my notes to ensure I'm
following the steps correctly.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Not really I know it is an intergal part of the development process and hope to
get a firm grasp of the material soon by repitition.  I'm sure questions will
come up as the work becomes more involved.
