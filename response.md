# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I learn best by actually doing things and some repetition.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
TryGit was probably the most helpful since it gave me extra practice.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I think the Comparing Workflows by Atlassian was a little difficult to read than necessary since
I am not at all familiar with Subversion. Comparisons between Subversion and Git would be much
more helpful if I knew what Subversion was.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I think I'm getting there. I feel comfortable with initializing git and doing basic add and
commit commands including push and pull and branch requests. Could use more practice with
removing git changes, unstaging commits, etc. Fist/Five = 4/5.


```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
So far so good. Consultants have been doing a great job so far, even though there are varying
levels of experience within our large group.
```
