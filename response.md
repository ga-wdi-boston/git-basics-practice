# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
Explaination, followed by doing.  Trial by fire has been the best
for me.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
The readings and this exercise, to download, open and fill out this survey.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I did not like the online games - they just gave me the answers and I filled them out.  I do not feel like I learned much from those online games.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I feel comfortable with the basic commands that we learned: created directories, files, opening them using CLI, initializing, adding, committing and pushing.  Also forking, cloning and updating.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Nothing burning, I just want to keep using it so I am more comfortable with it.  It sounds like that will be the case moving forward :)
```
