# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
1 - Read and/or listen to new material
2 - Try by "doing" through lab or exercise
3 - If stuck, ask questions after due dilgence!
4 - Take notes in editor and bookmark sites for future reference
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
In order:
1 - Code School Try Git tutorial (Small steps and type in commands)

2 - Git Workflows and Tutorials (https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
was good but rather long.  I need to "try" each workflow to reinforce this tutorial.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
None
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
4 of 5 - Need to practice more but I understand that I will do this git
fork/clone/edit/add/commit/push workflow multiple times during WDI.

3 of 5 - Branching and remote repositories - Need more practice
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
None ... yet!  :-)
```
