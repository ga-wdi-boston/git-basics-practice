# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
I think I learn best listening to workshops and working through questions
as a group, then having some time to practice on my own.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I thought that the atlassian overview was thorough, but a bit confusing```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s), if any, was the most frustrating and why?

```md
I found the github tutorial with the cats not as helpful
because they told you exactly what to do.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I think I could do the most basic version of it pretty well, but I don't
understand how rebase works very well.
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
I can clearly see how useful it would be. The one piece of advice one
of my friends gave me was make sure to use to learn git and github well,
so I definitely want to make sure I do so I don't annoy future coworkers.
```
