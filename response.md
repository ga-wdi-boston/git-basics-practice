# Git Basics: Practice

## Learning Style

How do you learn best?

```md
Practice and hands on repetition.
```

## The Most Effective Resource(s)

Which resource(s) from the practice helped you the most?

```md
I enjoyed the lectures, but the written documentation with step by step
instructions is key.
```

## The Least Effective Resource(s)

```md
When we had to read the two short articles about best practices for committing
and then discuss with the team -  I didn't think that was helpful.
```

## Workflow Comfort

How comfortable are you with the workflow (the series of steps and the git
commands) that we use to share work and responses?

```md
I feel like I still need a lot of practice.  There are so many steps.  It's not
100% clear to me when changes I make to the file status (staging, committing, etc.)
actually affect the contents of the file.  Sometimes it changes or deletes the
actual file, but sometimes not...
```

## Git Questions

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

```md
Just need practice.
```
