How do you learn best?

-By following along in class and then by practicing on my own. Being able to ask
questions, when I need to.

Which resources from this document helped you the most?

-I liked the github.io tutorial.. I like following along and doing things rather
than just reading.

Which resource (if any) was most frustrating? Why?

-Just trying to initially understand the staging aspect and pulling/pushing.

How comfortable are you with the workflow (series of steps and git commands)
we use to share work and responses?

-4.5/5

Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this
course?

-Nope, I couldn't wait to learn how to use it from the command line! Now I know.
