do you learn best?
I learn best by repetition. I am also an auditory learner
Which resources from this document helped you the most?
Definitely the TryGit module from codeschool was the most helpful for me.
Which resource (if any) was most frustrating? Why?
I found the learngitbranching module to be very frustrating because I couldnt go back and look at commands. I also found it difficult to navigate within the branches, especially in the later lessons
How comfortable are you with the workflow (series of steps and git commands) we use to share work and responses?
On a scale from 1-10 I am probably a 5 in terms of my comfort.
Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this course?
I am sure we will use it to monitor our progress as we complete assignments and projects throughout the course.
